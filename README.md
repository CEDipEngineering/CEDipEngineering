## About me

My name is Carlos Dip. I'm a computer engineer (currently 7th semester in college).

I'm quite familiar with lots of programming languages, and have implemented many projects from scratch, most of which you can see here in Github.

My main language is Python, often in Jupyter Notebook environments, however I'm familiar with JavaScript/CSS/HTML, Java, C, VHDL, and a few others. I have used many famous frameworks in the past for applied projects, such as MySQL, Django, NodeJS+React, MongoDB, FastAPI, and some others.

I have worked with many Machine Learning projects, such as Naive Bayes sentiment classification, Random Forest iamge classifiers, and Convolutional Neural Networks for image processing (alongside other traditional computer vision algorithms) 

I have also worked with Cloud infrastructure deployment (both manually and developed fully automated boto3 python scripts) on AWS.
